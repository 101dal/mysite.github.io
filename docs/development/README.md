# Development

This part is for developers. If you want to help to the project, you can join the discord server [there](https://discord.gg/dS2Wxyr).

## Language(s)

All the project will use **Typescript** which is compatible and very similar to Javascript. The final goal is to be able to have a working system running with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

## Project structure

The project is separated in 3 parts:

* [`server`](./server): a web app which will permit modpacks's creator and server's owner to manage modpacks and launchers
* [`client`](./client): a NodeJS library which permit to download modpacks since the configuration downloaded from the server
* [`documentation`](./documentation): this is this website which will need to be maintained to stay updated and translated in multiple languages.
